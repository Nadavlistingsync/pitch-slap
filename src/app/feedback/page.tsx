Your market sizing is straight up delusional. "Billion dollar market" my ass! You're not even close to product-market fit, and your burn rate is giving me anxiety.

But hey, I actually like your team. They seem smart enough to not completely fuck this up. Just... maybe don't quit your day job yet? 

Here's what you need to fix:
1. Your go-to-market strategy is basically "we'll figure it out" - that's not gonna cut it
2. Your competition slide is missing like 5 major players
3. Your financial projections are making me laugh harder than a Frenchman watching American football

Keep it real, and maybe we'll talk again when you've got some actual traction.`;

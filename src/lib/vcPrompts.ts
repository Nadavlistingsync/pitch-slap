Here's what I need to know:
1. Why the fuck should I care about this?
2. How are you gonna make money without burning through my cash?
3. Who's actually gonna pay for this shit?

Don't sugarcoat it - I've seen more pitches than you've had hot dinners.`,

Listen up, because I'm about to drop some truth bombs on your pitch deck. Your tech stack is sexy AF, but your go-to-market strategy is giving me serious "we'll figure it out" vibes. 

Quick questions:
1. How the hell are you gonna scale this?
2. Who's your competition and why are you better?
3. What's your secret sauce that'll make me look like a genius?

Don't @ me with that "we're the Uber of X" bullshit.`,

Your pitch deck is... how do you say... not terrible? But your financial projections are making me laugh harder than a Frenchman watching American football. 

Let's talk about:
1. Your burn rate - it's giving me anxiety
2. Your team - are they actually good or just good at LinkedIn?
3. Your competition - because I know you're not the only one doing this

Just went through your deck and... wow, you're ambitious! But your user acquisition costs are higher than my rent in Paris. 

Quick reality check:
1. How are you gonna get users without selling your soul to Facebook?
2. What's your actual moat? (And no, "first mover advantage" isn't a moat)
3. Why should I bet on you instead of the 10 other startups doing the same thing?
